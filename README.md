# ColumnFileView.NET
View and manipulate files with a few steps

This application uses xml-based templates to transform logfiles or other high-structured files in a column-style table.
That allows administrators to analyze big logfiles faster.
It also supports "load N last lines of file" and it uses my default all cpu threads to achieve the best performance with larger files.
You can use an command-line interface (.net framework cli app OR .net core 2.2 cli) to transform files an to save them into a CSV or XML.
